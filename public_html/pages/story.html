<p id="intro">In 2013, an outbreak surges overnight when a mutant Cordyceps fungus starts speading over the United States, taking control over human hosts and turning them into aggressive creatures called "infected" to spread the fungus spores rapidly.
<br/>
    In the suburbs of Austin, Texas Joel comes home to his daughter and puts her to sleep. At midnight, a chaos occurs starting from city hospital. Sarah, Joel's daughter, wakes up by sound of chaos and starts searching for Joel.
    She finds Joel fighting his neighbour, who was infected, ultimately shotting him in head to save Sarah.
<br/><br/>
    Later, Tommy (Joel's brother) arrives at his house and picks them in his car to flee the city. On their way, they are attacked by an infected mob, escaped from nearby hospital. The mob started attacking civilians and spreading the fungus even more rapidly.
    Tommy rushes his car away from it, ultimately resulting in an accident. Joel and Tommy are fine but Sarah's leg gets broken. Joel carries Sarah and starts running on foot with his brother Tommy.
    After, almost reaching the outskirts, Joel encounters a soldier who was given orders not to let anyone outside the city.
    The soldier opens up fire at Joel and Sarah, knocking them down. The soldier is shot by Tommy as he double checks the bodies.
    Joel survives the shots but Sarah is severy injured Ultimately, Sarah dies there in her father's arms. </p>

<p id="newdawn" >The fungus takes over the United States. The number of confirmed deaths starts rising. The Governor calls a state of emergency but still hundreds of bodies are lying in the streets.<br/>
    Finally, panic spreads worldwide after a report is leaked from World Health Organization showed that the vaccination tests have failed.<br/> The US Government collapses and the states are put under martial law.
    Residents are forced to get into designated quarantine, causing riots with the military. The ration touches all time low. Amid this situation, a secret group called "Fireflies" is formed by rebelions starts attacking the military. The military starts executing Fireflies as soon as it finds one.

<p id="intro">20 years later, we find Joel living in a quarantine zone, where civilization has been compromised by the infection.
    In the United States, civilians are placed in quarantine zones set up by FEDRA. Those living outside the zones are oftentimes desperate survivors living at their own risks.
    Joel, living in the Boston quarantine zone, is now a smuggler, items, and weapons through the zone's walls. Tess, his friend and business partner, informs him that
    she was attacked by Robert's men, a past friend who is in debt with them.
    They decide to confront him in his warehouse. While walking, they find ration line hasn't opened yet, but people are already lining up due to shortages. People are forced to survive by eating animals like rats, cats and other pets.

<p id="newdawn"> Joel and Tess encounter an infection check nearby, where four civilians are dragged out of a nearby condemned building by soldiers in HAZMAT suits,
    who scan them to see if they are infected. The first two are found to be clean, but the third tests positive.
    Despite pleading that she isn't, she is lethally injected by a soldier, killing her. The fourth civilian attempts to flee, only to be shot dead.

    Afterwards, the duo arrives at the checkpoint. As they are about to go through, a terrorist attack by a rebel group known as the Fireflies destroys a military vehicle.
    This causes the Army to close the checkpoint and order everyone in the area to get off the streets.
    This forces Joel and Tess to take a detour through a series of tunnels and the outside of the area.

<p id="intro"> Upon arriving, Robert is afraid and terrrified of them. Joel and Tess bribe their way in to the Slums, walking past several black market stalls.
    Some men offer Tess a bargain but she brushes him off.
    As Joel crosses past a fistfight, several spectators betting their ration cards, a guard tries to stop him.
    Just as Joel is about to fight him, Tess catches up, telling the man to sit down, to which he complies; having recognized Tess.
    The pair learn from another guard that Robert has returned to the wharf. They pursue him, killing his men that try to stop Tess and Joel from reaching him.
    They progress through a series of warehouses with many men patrolling the area, eventually reaching Robert. After not coming down to any agreement, Tess shots Robert.
    After a short pursuit, Robert is caught and reveals to Joel and Tess that he gave the guns he owed them to the Fireflies,
    to whom he was also in debt. He offers to go after them and get the weapons back, but Tess shoots him dead.
    As they decide what to do next, Marlene, the leader of the Fireflies appears.</p>

<p id="newdawn">Marlene, the Queen Firefly, nursing a gunshot wound from an earlier skirmish with the military.
    She offers to give them the guns back and more, but only if they smuggle something to Boston's capitol building.
    After passing by more military patrols, she introduces them to a teenage girl, Ellie, the "cargo".
    Joel hesitates at first, but agrees to the job after Marlene shows Tess the guns, and they leave later that night.

<p id="intro"> While Tess checks for the weapons held by Marlene and other Fireflies, Joel takes Ellie to somewhere safe until Tess comes back after verifying the weapons.
    After Tess returns, she affirms the weapons are with Marlene and the pact has been madae. Tess asks Joel whether he is up for the job, Joel agrees.
    Joel, Tess, and Ellie head outside the wall to begin their journey to the capitol building.
    The two wonder who Ellie is, Tess theorizing that she is "some big-wig's daughter". They proceed through the underground tunnels under the apartment building,
    reaching a ladder that leads to just outside the wall. Tess has Joel go first to make sure everything is clear.
    They notice a patrol in the distance but proceed anyway. Ellie briefly remarks that this is her first time outside the wall.
    The three proceed through a truck only for Joel to be surprised by soldiers who detain the trio.

<p id="newdawn">One soldier orders her subordinate to scan the three for traces of infection while she radios to command.
    Tess tries to bribe them but is told to shut up. A nervous Ellie attacks a soldier as he scans her, stabbing him in the leg.
    She tries to attack again but is knocked down, the soldier preparing to shoot her. Luckily, Joel reacts in time, tackling the soldier to the ground.
    As the two struggle, Tess shoots the other, the latter having been distracted by her comrade's conflict. After a brief struggle, Joel wrestles the soldier's gun away
    and kills him.
    <br/>

    As the three catch their breath, Tess notices the scanner that soldier had been using is bleeping. Upon checking it, it reveals that Ellie is infected.
    Joel and Tess frighten and asks for an explain, but Ellie claims the bite mark on her arm has been present for three weeks, despite the infection typically
    turning the victim into an Infected within two days at most.
    Joel doesn't believe it, claiming that Marlene set them up. Before they can act on this, more soldiers show up, so the three must flee the area.
    They sneak past several soldiers in the trenches but are met with another patrol. Knowing that there are too many to fight off, they escape the wall perimeter
    through the sewers as the soldiers are called back.

<p id="intro">With time to think, Joel and Tess discuss their options. Ellie explains that her immunity could lead to a cure. Joel is against completing the mission
    while Tess seems hopeful at the thought of a cure. Joel tries to dissuade her from the mission, reminding her of the infected and hostile survivors.
    Tess understands but is reluctant to change her mind. Tess and Ellie begin to walk to the Capitol Building, leaving Joel to follow.

    They proceed through downtown Boston and reach a large chasm, which forces the three to enter the partially-collapsed Goldstone Building.<br>

    As they pass through the unstable building, they encounter a number of infected, including Clickers, Infected for a long time.
    Tess explains what they are to Ellie while Joel forces the door open. Once through, Joel is tackled to the ground by a clicker but is saved by Tess, who shoots it dead.

    They push on, finding a patrol of soldiers that had come through the same building but were killed by stalkers.
    They climb a wall, evading clickers by throwing bricks and bottles to distract the creatures. They reach the other end of the building but are met with a large group of runners;
    Joel must eliminate several of them so that the group can pass safely. Once done, Tess commends Joel but he shrugs her off. They make it to a subway station, finding dead
    Fireflies and a Molotov cocktail. They find a note that tells them they aren't the group they should be meeting. After bypassing several infected, they exit to the streets.

<p id="newdawn">On their way, A wave of infected chase Joel, Tess, and Ellie into a building.
    It turns out to be a museum still containing a number of exhibits. Tess and Ellie crawl through an opening that collapses,
    leaving Joel alone as clickers appear. He makes his way through the museum to find a runner attacking a door.
    Inside he finds Tess and Ellie in trouble, as a number of infected are attacking the two. After a short fight with numerous infected, they finally clear the area of
    infected and continue to the roof.<br/><nbsp><br/>
    Joel, Tess, and Ellie reach the Capitol building, but find a dead Firefly near the perimeter. As they enter the building, they find that all the Fireflies have been
        killed by the military, and Joel and Tess argue about what to do next. Tess frantically searches one of the corpses for a map or directions to the lab that Ellie was going to.
        Joel argues that they are taking this too far, that they should just go home.<br/>
        Tess then reveals that she was bitten. She shows Joel her wound and remarks that it is already worse than Ellie's, although she was only bitten an hour ago,
        while Ellie's is three weeks old. Tess asks Joel to take Ellie to Tommy because he will know where the Firefly lab is located. Joel protests, but Tess asks him to do it
        for her. Tess says, "There's enough here that you have to feel some sort of obligation to me." Before Joel can answer, the military shows up and Tess sacrifices herself to give Joel and Ellie
        some time to escape into the subway station outside the Capitol Building. They pass through the subway, encountering several flooded sections before leaving Boston behind for
        good.

<p id="intro">After Ellie and Joel escape the soldiers where Tess was shot down, Joel asks Ellie to never bring up "Tess" again and instructed her to do whatever he says. Ellie, quite hesitatingly,
    nods her head. Joel and Ellie head into the woods on the outskirts of the town of Lincoln, Massachusetts.
    Ellie enjoys her first encounter with nature, since she had never left the Boston quarantine zone before.
    They come up to an old water tower and work their way into the town, where Joel's friend Bill lives.
    They see a column of smoke in the distance and decide to head in that direction. Joel warns Ellie that Bill is a good guy, but is completely paranoid and dislikes strangers.
    They find that the town is filled with Bill's traps, barricades, and homemade bombs to keep the infected from getting too close to his safehouses.
    They make their way through the back alleys until they reach a garage where Joel is caught in one of Bill’s traps, resulting in him hanging upside down while Ellie attempts
    to cut him free as he shoots the infected that rush in their direction. <br/>
    Just as Joel is about to be bitten, Bill rescues them and leads them to an abandoned laundromat where they battle more infected before escaping into a bar.

    <br/><br/>
    As they rush into the bar, Bill is distrustful and angry at them for setting off his traps and attracting so many infected to the area. He owes Joel a favor,
    who asks him for a car to get to his brother Tommy in Wyoming. Bill reluctantly agrees, but says that there are no functioning cars in town, only parts. First,
    they must go to his other safehouse to gather weapons and supplies, because the parts are in a school filled with infected. They reach his safehouse, in a church.
    They gear up before heading out. Ellie wants a weapon as well, but Joel refuses. Bill says that if they do this, then he owes Joel no more favors.

<p id="newdawn">The three head out towards the graveyard, sneaking their way through an infestation of clickers, and make their way through the rest of the infected-filled town.
    They reach the school and kill the runners surrounding it before hiding from more infected by climbing through a window near where the military truck crashed into the school.
    A wave of infected closes in on them and they run into the school to escape. After Bill realizes that the battery in the military truck is gone, he, Joel, and Ellie work
    their way through the school and run into a Bloater (an Infected whose body is taken up by the fungus entirely). After deafeating the Bloater, they arrive at
    Bill's friend. After getting no response, they break into the house.

    who committed suicide after being bitten so he wouldn't turn. They find a truck in the garage with Bill's battery in it, and if Joel searches the house,
    the note from Frank can be found. Joel can give this note to Bill, who reads it, crumples it up, and tosses it aside before the pair prepare to push the car down the nearby
    hill to start it. Ellie drives until Bill orders her to stop once they have escaped the infected. Bill then parts ways with Joel and Ellie, giving Joel a siphon hose to
    scavenge gasoline from abandoned cars. Before letting them leave, Bill confirms with Joel that they're square—no more favors to owe.

<p id="newdawn">Whilst driving to Tommy's, Ellie complains to Joel about a comic called "Savage Starlight". Although it is a good read, the ending is a cliffhanger.
    Joel asks her where she got it, to which she hesitantly responds, "back at Bill's". Joel asks what else she stole to which she gives him a cassette tape to play on
    the truck's radio. Joel says that it is before his time in response to Ellie saying it should make him nostalgic. She even reveals she stole a magazine with
    "some interesting photos". Joel realizes it is a gay pornography magazine, which she shouldn't see. Ellie then discards it quite jokingly.

<p id="intro">Joel decides to go through the city rather than back up and detour around. While driving through the city,
    Joel and Ellie see a person stumble into the middle of the street, begging for help. Ellie wants to stop and help, but Joel sees through the act and tries to speed past.
    The person, who had feigned his injuries, pulls out a gun and more men come out of hiding. One of them throws a brick at the truck, damaging the windshield.
    The hunters push a bus into Joel’s truck, causing them to crash into a hardware store where they are forced to confront the hunters.
    After eliminating the ambush group, the duo passes through their hideout and make their way to a long-abandoned military checkpoint.
    Along the way, they discover that the military had been overthrown by the citizens who were now the hunters. At the checkpoint, the pair come across another group of hunters
    and stealthily made their way through the bookstore and into a back alley.

<p id="newdawn">Just outside a hotel, Joel spots a hunting rifle and another group of hunters. Joel plans to clear a path while Ellie stays behind in the scaffolding to cover him
    with the rifle, which he teaches her how to use a few minutes beforehand. Before he leaves, Joel subtly thanks her for saving him from the hunter, reconciling their relationship.
<br/>
    Joel attempts to take out each hunter quickly and quietly but is soon discovered, prompting Ellie to snipe from her scaffolding. After all the hunters are dealt with,
    Joel gives Ellie a 9mm pistol, insisting that its "for emergencies only" showing his newfound trust in her. The pair makes their way through the financial district though
    they are spotted by the Humvee and patrolling hunters. The hunter crew immediately begins to give chase to Joel and Ellie. Using the debris and back streets as cover,
    the pair retreats into a building, seemingly losing the Humvee in the process.
    <br/>
    As Joel enters a room using the outside ledge he is grabbed from behind by a man. Ellie tries to help with her switchblade but is knocked aside.
    The man notices her and while he is distracted, Joel throws him off and heavily beats him. Ellie shouts out to stop, as they spot a boy pointing a gun at Joel.
    The man however tells the boy that it is all right, and introduces themselves as Henry and Sam, two brothers and survivors from another group.
    Henry comments on how hard Joel hit him, Joel confessing he was trying to kill the man. Henry confesses the same; he only stopped attacking when he saw Ellie.
    He thought Joel was a hunter but "they don't keep kids around." While Ellie thinks that they can help each other escape the city, Joel is not so trusting.

<p id="intro">They finally arrive at the tower, and take a temporary reprieve. Henry and Joel bond over stories of Joel and Tommy renting a pair of Harleys to drive cross country.
    After Ellie excuses herself to visit Sam, who is taking inventory of the food they had found that day, Henry reluctantly faces the fact no one from his original group will come.
    <br/>
    Meanwhile, Ellie and Sam converse about their fears, their accomplishments, and the existential possibility of an infected still being human, deep down. At first,
    Ellie uses humor to deflect Sam's probing queries, but eventually responds accordingly. Ellie admits she is afraid of being left alone, and Sam is scared of being infected.
    Sam tells Ellie that his brother once said, that the infected were no longer 'people'; that they've 'moved on'. Ellie agrees, telling Sam that that person is 'not in there
    anymore'. Before Ellie bids Sam goodnight, she remembers to give him the toy robot he was fiddling with back in Pittsburgh. With her parting words, 'if Henry doesn't know about
    it, he can't take it away,' she leaves for bed. After a moment, Sam drops the toy to the ground, and pulls up his pant leg to reveal an infected scratch.
    <br/>
    The following morning, Ellie wakes up to Henry cooking breakfast. She asks where Sam is, and Henry replies that he let him sleep in 'for once'. Henry suggests she go wake him,
    and she readily agrees. However, moments after she enters the room she is attacked by Sam, who has turned overnight. Panicked, Joel searches his bag for his gun, but Henry
    deters him with a stray round from his own gun.<br/>
    Henry hesitates, prompting Joel to reach for his weapon again. No sooner he does this than Henry shoots his brother in the head. Distraught over his actions, Henry blames
    either Joel or himself for what has happened to Sam and commits suicide, shooting himself in the head.

<p id="newdawn"> Along the Snake River Trail of Jackson County, Wyoming—months after Henry and Sam's deaths—Joel tells Ellie about his brother Tommy joining and quitting the
    Fireflies, and how they got separated on bad terms. She wonders if he will help them, to which Joel responds, "I guess we'll find out". They go past a dam, and encounter a
    small grave with a teddy bear on it, that makes Ellie think about Sam and his robot toy. Joel refuses to talk about it, and he tells her to just move on with her life. <br/>
    They eventually reach the closed gate of a power plant, and are held at gunpoint by several people. Tommy is among them, and he greets his brother with a hug. He introduces
    them to Maria, his wife, who along with her father, is in charge of a nearby self-sustained settlement of people, and are using the power plant for electricity. Ellie talks to
    Maria about how she learned to ride a horse after noticing one outside of the plant, prompting Joel to ask her who taught her. As he shows Joel around, Tommy says he went back
    to Texas a few months back, and tries to give Joel a picture of him and Sarah together he found at his house, but Joel refuses. The brothers later witness the workers getting
    the power generator up and running again.
<br/>
    In private, Joel tells Tommy about Ellie's immunity and asks him to bring her to the Fireflies, which Tommy refuses, since he is now responsible for all the people of his
    community. Angered, Joel shoves him and calls him ungrateful for all the years he kept the two alive, but Tommy replies that he's "got nothing but nightmares from those years".
    As he says this, the plant is attacked by bandits, forcing Joel to help Tommy fight them. After eliminating the bandits, Tommy agrees to take her, but Ellie, suspecting that Joel
    is going to leave her, steals one of their horses and runs off into the woods.

<p id="newdawn">Joel and Ellie arrive to the University of Eastern Colorado on horseback and start searching the campus for the science building,
    which according to Tommy looks like a "giant mirror." Ellie names the horse Callus, since Joel forgot to ask Tommy the horse's name. As they search, Joel starts to share a bit more about his past, telling her about his childhood dream to be a singer and how he never got to attend college due to being a father so early, and talking to Ellie about football. He goes off on his own at one point, passing through a dormitory filled with infected, in order to reach the generator that opened a locked gate. They start to realize how strange it is that the place is completely deserted and that they should have seen someone by now, since the only thing they encountered was a group of monkeys running around in a square near the dorms. He speculates optimistically that the large number of infected are used by the Fireflies as a defense mechanism, as Bill did.
    <br/>
    As they enter the science building, they realize that the Fireflies had left in a hurry, for reasons unknown. Joel finds a recorder near a corpse of a Firefly scientist,
    and learns that they were using monkeys as test subjects, trying to study the effects of the Cordyceps brain infection in order to find a cure. The scientist, who had been
    instructed to kill the infected test subjects, instead believed they deserved to be free. While trying to let them out of their cages, he is bitten by one, subsequently passing
    the infection onto him.
    <br/>
    Listening to a scientist's recorder, they learn that the Fireflies have gone to Salt Lake City, Utah, to continue their research. As soon as they discover this,
    a group of looters ambush them. Joel and Ellie make their way through the building, killing their attackers as they go. Joel is caught by surprise by one of them,
    when they burst through a door he opened. They struggle briefly, but the looter drags Joel down with him, and they both fall off the balcony.
    The looter dies on impact, but Joel is impaled by a piece of rebar sticking up from the ground. Ellie climbs down and helps him to his feet, and guides him towards the exit.
    <br/>
    Ellie is forced to protect the both of them, as Joel is incapacitated by pain, and extreme blood loss. They manage to exit the building and, after Ellie shoots a looter who
    attempts to steal Callus, ride away from the university. Suddenly, Joel slumps and falls off the
    horse, passing out. Ellie tries to wake him up, calling his name and asking him what she should do.

<p id="intro">It is winter, and Ellie kills a rabbit with an arrow. She then spots a deer and hunts it down, hitting it with the bow a couple times before tracking its blood trail.
    It collapses near a barn on the outskirts of an abandoned coal mine. As she approaches it, two strangers appear, David and James. They offer to trade with her for the meat,
    and she says that if they have medicine, they can have the whole deer. David asks her to come with them, but she refuses and sends James to get penicillin while Ellie holds
    David at gunpoint. They go inside a large warehouse to avoid the cold, as a large number of infected start to surround them. They hold their position for a while but are forced
    to run away, only to get cornered again. After they dispatch them, she sits down with David as he tells how a bunch of his men were killed a few weeks back by "a crazy man",
    a man who was "traveling with a little girl." Alarmed, she gets up and points the rifle at him as James arrives. David orders him to stand down and give her the medicine, and
    Ellie runs away back to an abandoned house, where Joel is unconscious and feverish. She gives him the medicine and lays down next to him.<br/>

    The next morning, Ellie wakes up hearing the bandits outside. She mounts Callus and rides off in order to get their attention, but they kill the horse, forcing her to hide
    in an abandoned resort. She makes her way to an inn, and as she tries to leave, David shows up behind her and chokes her until she passes out.
    <br/>
    Joel wakes up, and as he goes outside to look for her, a group of remaining bandits starts to shoot him. He deals with them, and manage to capture two. He then proceeds to torture them for Ellie's whereabouts, and when one of them gives in, Joel kills them.

<p id="newdawn">Ellie wakes up in a cage; she sees James cut off a corpse's limbs for his group to eat. David comes in, and says that he doesn't want to kill her — he only wishes
    for her to join them. Now realizing his true intentions, she refuses to cooperate, breaking his finger to make a grab for his keys. Later, he and James hold her down on the
    table to kill her for food, and she tells them she's infected. Taking advantage of their distraction, she grabs David's knife, kills James, and runs out into a snowstorm.

<p id="intro">Armed with only her switchblade, she goes to an abandoned restaurant while David tracks her. Holding the keys to her freedom, Ellie must sneak and catch David by
    surprise —
    while the building starts to catch fire and burn. After stabbing him several times, he panics and grabs her by her hair, slamming her into the ground. They both fall unconscious.
    Ellie wakes up first, and crawls to get his discarded machete. As she gets close, he rushes over to kick her, taunting that she should just give up.
    When she struggles to move, he hits her again, pinning her down and nearly strangling her. She blindly grasps for the hilt of the machete, and slashes his arm.
    Caught unexpectedly, he screams and rolls off her. She repeatedly hacks at his face in a rage, until Joel arrives and pulls her off.

    Holding a crying Ellie in his arms, Joel consoles her and leads her away.

<p id="newdawn">On the night of April 28, 2034, Joel wakes up in a hospital bed to find Marlene welcoming him to the Fireflies. After apologizing for the bump on the head, Marlene
    asks how Joel and Ellie managed to find the Fireflies, to which Joel responds that Ellie "fought like hell" to get here.

    Joel asks to see Ellie but Marlene denies him, saying that she is being prepped for surgery as they speak. Marlene reveals that the Cordyceps in Ellie's brain has somehow
    mutated according to the doctors, hence why she is immune. Studying her brain would allow the doctors to reverse-engineer a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection, though
    since the fungus grows all over the brain, Joel figures out that Ellie would be killed, insisting that Marlene find someone else only to be detained by her guard, Ethan.
    <br/>
    Foreseeing this, and knowing that Joel had formed a close bond with Ellie in the past year to the point that he would not allow the surgery to proceed, Marlene orders Ethan
    to march Joel out of the hospital and kill him if he tries anything. Marlene leaves, and Joel, after seeing his backpack, disarms and tortures Ethan to tell him where the
    operating room is. Finding out that it is on the top floor.

<p id="intro">Alerted by the gunshots, the Fireflies find Ethan's corpse and proceeded to search for and attempt to kill Joel. Joel evades or kills them and blocks off the West Wing
    access. On the top floor, Joel finds several recordings, one being the head surgeon's assessment of Ellie's immunity and two others recording Marlene's indecision and reluctance
    to kill the child she promised to look after. Joel eventually finds the surgery room as more Fireflies guarded the hallway leading to the operating room. After killing and/or
    evading them, Joel bursts into the operating room, where the doctors were surprised to find him. The head surgeon, Jerry Anderson, tries to prevent Joel from taking an
    unconscious Ellie by blocking his way but is killed by Joel. Leaving the two assistants to their fate, Joel carries Ellie away as more Fireflies close in on him. He manages
    to get to the elevator and reach the parking garage but is confronted by Marlene.

<p id="newdawn">Marlene attempts to reason with him, asking how long Ellie can live safely without being eaten by clickers or raped and murdered by other survivors.
    Joel disregards this, saying that it is not Marlene's choice to decide but unsure if it is what Ellie wants. Marlene allows him to live if he gives Ellie back
    to the Fireflies and slowly puts down her gun as a sign of trust while walking towards him. Joel flees away with Ellie anyway. As Joel drives out of the city, Ellie wakes up,
    wondering what had happened. Joel answers that they'd found the Fireflies. He goes on to say that there were dozens of people who were immune like Ellie and the Fireflies
    were unable to develop a vaccine from them, to the point that they've stopped looking for a cure. Ellie sadly rests up while Joel takes them back home and apologizes.
    Joel decides to take ellie back to Tommy's where she can live with him.

<p id="intro">A flashback comes in Joel's mind, when Ellie asks him about the Firefly and Marlene. When confronted my Marlene, Joel actually shot Marlene.
    He knew that Marlene is determined to find a cure and would chase Ellie to take out the immune mutation in her brain to develop a vaccine.
    After the first shot in gut, Marlene pleads for her life but Joel shots her in head saying "You'd just come after her[Ellie]".

<p id="newdawn">As Joel and Ellie walk back to Tommy's, Ellie was still not convinced that her immunity means nothing. She asks Joel again and tells her about the day she was bitten,
    along with her friend Riley who was first to die, then Tess and then Sam. Joel tells her no matter what you keep finding something to fight for. Ellie interrupts Joel, asking him
    to swear that everything he said was true about the Fireflies. Joel lies by saying "I swear" ultimately saving Ellie. Ellie replies "Okay".

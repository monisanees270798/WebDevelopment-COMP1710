    <h3>Reflection of my Journey</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        I am reflecting my journey through COMP6780 (Web Development) that almost comes to an end. This document will reflect upon my learning and application process I adopted to better understand the principles of web development and design. Beginning by listing my learning objectives I collected at the commencement of the course, I can now tick out theme objectives fulfilled and to what extent.
        I will try to list any problems that I found during the process and how they got resolved and how the solutions helped me to face  my future assignments and to correct myself and become more efficient and productive.
        Meeting the Learning Objectives
        Towards the beginning of the course, Ms Sabrina handed us the road map for the entire journey for this course, it was about every topic we touched every week. Some learning objectives that I hoped to achieve throughout the duration of the course were:
        <ul>
    <li>Improve web organisational skills</li>
        <li>Develop technical coding ability</li>
        <li>Deep understanding of the processes of Web development at front end and back end</li>
</ul>
    <br>
    The first learning objective was to Improve my organisational skills. At the start of my assignment, I created webpage based on a game I love, “The Last of Us Guide”. This allowed me to comply with the list of tasks that I was marked upon as presented in assignment.html My collected content and webpages related to my website, helped me align myself with deadlines to ensure that my time is well spent and that I am productive. This learning objective has been met and using various features on developing a source log and categorized folders to get my work organised in an efficient way.
    Another way in which I began organise my work was to upload all the code into my ANU Partch Account, a platform open to ANU students. This is also a way to back up any code that may be lost or revert back. I used the software, GitBash to manage files and push all files to my account. A problem I found with this was it was a bit troublesome as cmd.exe didn’t help ultimately it was GlobalProtect and Gitbash that help me log into my partch account.
    This would have ensured that the website was regularly updated consistently before assignment submissions. I felt I met the learning objective to become more organised.
    Another learning objective that I had was to develop my technical abilities within coding languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Prior to starting this course I had only a very basic knowledge of HTML & CSS which I had gained from High School. The knowledge was very limited and I didn’t feel confident in creating websites I see online.
    I had previously had no experience in JavaScript other than the Alert feature in JS. I aimed to start by learning the basics throughout  lectures so that I could create expert level sites using Human centred design. This has been achieved using the Wattle JavaScript directory where I got a glance at the very basic components of JS and then used my knowledge gained over the assignment to add dynamic site. The JS skills learnt has met beyond my aim and I feel confident to use it in my future life as a Web Developer and have even applied it to online coding quizzes (codecamedy.com) that I have been doing alongside.
    The final learning objective that I set was to gain a further understanding of the processes of real-life Web development. When setting myself this learning objective I had in mind to learning practises performed by real developers as I had no previous experience prior to the course.
    The frontend of a website is where we see and interact with on a browser. It is a “client-side” activity, it includes everything the user experiences directly: from text and colours to buttons, images, and navigation menus.
    In real life we see non Static websites that keeps changing as they showcase things like businesses, restaurants, LinkedIn profiles. The backend (“server-side”) is the portion of the website not visible to users. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. The backend communicates with the frontend, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page. Filling out a feedback form, type in a web address, or make transaction as a browser sends a request to the server-side, which returns information in the form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display.
    I went beyond the objective and actually learnt deep web working, something I didn’t even consider I would learn in the university. Therefore, I feel pleased with what I have achieved and can use these techniques and skills in my career ahead.

    <h4>Problems and Resolutions</h4>
    There were a number of problems that occurred during the process of creating a website due to the number of new skills and techniques that were necessary to learn and the complexity of the website that I wanted to achieve. Using various practices I managed to resolve most of these issues and create a good site that I am proud of.
    One problem that I found was with the styling (CSS). As I have been using only HTML, I found a few issues with its positioning and padding and borders. I got help from my course Piazza Forum and StackOverflow forum. This was an easy fix and used the inspect element to allow for a live preview and then once changed to the correct position, I implemented it into my CSS code.
    Another issue was when uploading a video (.mp4 file) to my partch account that was just 3 minutes but over 200MB. As suggested by tutor that keep videos in 360p to load faster else the user might click away from my website.

    <h4>Project Improvements</h4>
    There are several changes that I made based upon the feedback I got from tutors after grading. The main improvement was adding build and design. A problem I found with the previous website version was that although it’s a very good feature and meets the aims myself and the client had, it takes users away from the use externally onto other sites. By creating an internal service would ensure that users are kept on the site and could increase views and interactivity that they have with my site and improve their experience.
    One thing I really liked about my website was its ‘Interactive’ Image Map feature such as clicking and hovering upon different part of a single image. I feel that these small hooks give my website a unique feel so them and provide the user with a better experience. Now I understand the purpose of a user experience website designs.
    Originally when first doing the wireframes for the website, I had an idea to add a heart system in place similar to Instagram and Pinterest where users can like and view later. This was planned to be used for the look book feature to ‘save’ their favourite images to view quickly and easily at a later date. It wasn’t until I got further into the process that I realised the complexity that this would be and sadly did not have the time and knowledge to do so. However, I still feel that this is a great feature to the site and would love to implement it at a further date for the client.

    <h4>Personal and Professional Skill Improvements</h4>
    There are a number of Skill that I learnt throughout this course to better myself as a person too. One skill that I felt I learnt from this was professionalism and time management. As Ms. Sabrina helped me to write reports that matter and stand out for itself. I wanted to do so but lacked good samples. This is a great skill that I can continue forward into every project during work. Another improvement was upgrading my technical coding skillset something I had very little knowledge previously. I can humbly say that now I have skills essential for my career path as the world head towards human-cantered web development. (something SONA surveys gave me a deep understanding about)
    Since as a student, I have had many occasions to communicate with my peers both formally and informally during labs. This allowed me to develop my communication skills further. Such skills could be applied in my professional life when I talk to clients in the most appropriate professional manor giving me and my company a good reputation needed for working.

    <h4>Regards</h4>
    Cannot believe this journey is about to end, a journey that was not possible without Ms. Sabrina, Mr Tom Gedeon and Lab tutors.  I will miss the Socrative, the best in-lecture activity  (especially that "attention span of a Goldfish vs Human" question). All amazing MOOC sessions, quizzes and lab activities using JS Bin. I will miss Tom’s hilarious introduction at the beginning of every video. The weekly quizzes were so awesome with the re-attempting feature, I could visit echo360 to get all questions right.
    I feel so blessed to reflect on my journey and incredible memories this course has given me.
    I am so proud of my choice, selecting COMP6780 as a course.
    Thank you Team COMP9780.

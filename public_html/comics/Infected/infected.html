    <p> The infected are the result of a sudden outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus that now affects human beings as opposed
        to insects. The fungus reportedly originated in South American crops; various newspapers in Austin in 2013
        support this claim. The fungus infects the human brain, growing mycelium inside the brain tissue and killing the
        brain's cells. This erases their memories and drives them insane, modifying their instincts to seek no goal other
        than spreading the spores to others. Eventually the fungus kills its host, and will then grow out of the host's body
        to spread spores.<br>"<br>

        <b><i>They might still look like people, but that person is not in there anymore. ~Ellie</i></b><br>

    "<br>
    <b>Runners</b>:&nbsp;Runners are people who recently turned into infected. They are defined by their intense speed, sluggish attacks, and tendency to attack people in hordes<br>"<br>
        <b>Stalker</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalkers are people who have been infected from somewhere between two weeks to a year. Per their
        name, they stalk and hide from prey in the dark and attack at opportune moments. Some also latch onto walls and allow
        the Cordyceps to fester, keeping the host alive until prey walks by, at which point the stalker breaks free and attacks.<br>"<br>
        <b>Clicker</b>:&nbsp; Clickers are people who have been infected for at least one year. The long time elapse has allowed the fungus to spread all over their bodies, blinding them and forcing them to use echolocation to find prey. However, the fungus has granted them enhanced strength, making them fearsome foes in close-quarters combat.<br>"<br>
        <b>Bloater</b>:&nbsp; Bloaters have been infected for several years. The fungus has led them to become slow and blind, yet incredibly strong and resilient with the fungal growth serving as armor plating. bloaters can also tear fungus from their bodies to use as spore bombs and throw them at their enemies. However, this additional fungal growth makes them vulnerable to fire<br>"<br>
        <b>Shambler</b>:&nbsp; Shamblers are people who have been infected for several years and typically inhabit areas thriving with water. While not as physically enhanced as clickers or bloaters, shamblers are able to grapple prey and expel large spore clouds from their bodies, which cause acidic burns on the skin of prey. When killed, the spores explode, releasing a final burst of Cordyceps into the air.<br>"<br>
        <b>Rat King</b>:&nbsp; The rat king is a unique stage of infected that developed in the Seattle hospital after over twenty years of infection. Formed from several infected combining into one, the rat king is colossal in strength and size, and able to take extensive damage from fire, bombs, and guns. Even after taking much damage, it does not die, but instead, its various infected parts will start to break off from the larger mass and attack along with it.<br>"<br></p>
